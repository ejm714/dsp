For quick and easy interactive practice with Python, many people enjoy [Codecademy's Python track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). There's also [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/).

### Q1. Lists &amp; Tuples

How are Python lists and tuples similar and different? Which will work as keys in dictionaries? Why?

>> Both contain a list of values and values can be referenced by an index (ex. months[0]). Lists are written in square brackets and tuples in parentheses. The main difference is that tuples are immutable while lists are mutable. This means that you cannot change (add, delete, sort, etc.) the values in a tuple. Because they are immutable, tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries but lists cannot.  

>> To be used as a dictionary key, an object must be hashable – meaning that its hash value never changes during its lifetime. Hash values are used to quickly compare dictionary keys during a look up.

### Q3. Lambda Function

Describe Python's `lambda`. What is it, and what is it used for? Give at least one example, including an example of using a `lambda` in the `key` argument to `sorted`.

>> Lambdas are used to create anonymous functions (i.e. unnamed) and do not include a return statement. This is useful when a function is rather simple and is only used once, and thus can be written directly where it’s going to be used. Lambda can be used in functions that take a callable object as a parameter. 

>> For example, lambda is useful in sorting tuples by an object's index.
```python
colleagues_offices = [('emily', 303), ('jessica', 310), ('harold', 305)]
sorted(colleagues_offices, key=lambda tup: tup[1])
```

### Q4. List Comprehension, Map &amp; Filter

Explain list comprehensions. Give examples and show equivalents with `map` and `filter`. How do their capabilities compare? Also demonstrate set comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions.

### Complete the following problems by editing the files below:

### Q5. Datetime
Use Python to compute days between start and stop date.   
a.  

```
date_start = '01-02-2013'    
date_stop = '07-28-2015'
```

>> 937 days

b.  
```
date_start = '12312013'  
date_stop = '05282015'  
```

>> 82 days

c.  
```
date_start = '15-Jan-1994'      
date_stop = '14-Jul-2015'  
```

>> 7850 days
